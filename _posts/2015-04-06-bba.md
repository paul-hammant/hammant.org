Branch by Abstraction instead of Branch by Source Control! 

<a target="_blank" href="https://branchbyabstraction.com/">See the resource site I put together on it </a>. Well, perhaps I did not invent it as such,
but I was the first to document it in 2007.

Industry luminary Martin Fowler <a target="_blank" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BranchByAbstraction.html">wrote an article too</a> and links back to mine.
As does Jex Humble with <a target="_blank" href="https://continuousdelivery.com/2011/05/make-large-scale-changes-incrementally-with-branch-by-abstraction/">&qt;Make Large Scale Changes Incrementally with Branch By Abstraction&qt;</a>.

The pic above is from a <a target="_blank" href="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/branch-by-abstraction">page I wrote for the TrunkBasedDevelopment.com website</a>.
