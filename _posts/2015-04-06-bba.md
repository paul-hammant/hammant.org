Branch by Abstraction rocks: See my blog post <a target="_blank" href="https://paulhammant.com/blog/branch_by_abstraction.html">Introducing Branch By Abstraction</a> from 2007 (and related). Perhaps I did not invent it as such,
but I was the first to document it.

Industry luminary Martin Fowler

<a target="_blank" href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/BranchByAbstraction.html">wrote an article too</a> and links back to mine.
As does Jex Humble <a target="_blank" href="https://continuousdelivery.com/2011/05/make-large-scale-changes-incrementally-with-branch-by-abstraction/">Make Large Scale Changes Incrementally with Branch By Abstraction</a>.

The pic above is from a <a target="_blank" href="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/branch-by-abstraction">page I wrote for TrunkBasedDevelopment.com</a>.
