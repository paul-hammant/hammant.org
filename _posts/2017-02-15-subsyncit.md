caption: File sync technology that uses Subversion as a backing store
---

Subversion's really good at holding lots of terabytes of history, and crazily large files (tens of gigabytes), and makes a
great versioned backing store for the well understood "file sync" application. Companies might be attracted to this if
they like to fully control their own documents, or have custom workflows.
