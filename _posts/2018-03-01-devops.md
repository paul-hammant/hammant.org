I remotely visit companies who want to do software development more effectively, assess them, make a
plan with them and help them execute it. In particular this is helping them methodically get to Trunk-Based Development

My ongoing consulting is detailed here: <a target="_blank" href="https://devops.paulhammant.com">devops.paulhammant.com.</a>

I'm in the UK, so that's a UK Ltd company. Up to 2018, I was in the USA and I did the same through a US Llc.
