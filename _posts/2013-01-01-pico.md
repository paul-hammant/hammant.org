caption: The first 'constructor injection' DI container

I have been active in Apache's Avalon Framework project from 2000, but in 2003 pivoted 
with Aslak Hellesøy (more famous for Cucumber these days) towards another take on "Inversion of Control" to use constructors for 
dependencies, and made PicoContainer (<a target="_blank" href="http://picocontainer.com/">website</a>) 
for the Java community to use. It is still used today in the industry leading IDEs that JetBrains make.

I am guilty of <a target="_blank" href="http://www2.sys-con.com/itsg/virtualcd/java/archives/0812/hammant/index.html">defining some numerical sub-types for IoC</a>, 
before ThoughtWorks’ chief scientist, Martin Fowler, 
wrote his widely-read article renaming what I was talking about to Dependency Injection (DI)
