"Build Radiators as a Service" - a private and free build radiator for any development team. This is for teams with no radiator up on a
wall, and plenty of real reasons why Infosec will not let them put one up. There are many much more sophisticated
"Information Radiators" available, but teams can use this one to get to green first, AND STAY THERE, for no outlay (other than the Smart TV).
