Mostly as a consultant, but always as a leader, I have worked
at many blue chip employers and clients over the years in a variety
software related roles. Sometims direct, and sometimes as a consultant though ThoughtWorks (I was there 12.5 years).

Roles have either been:

* **delivery**: coding and shipping of solutions (architect, developer, test engineer)
* **executive**: chief of, head of, some group/division/function
* **advisory**: permanent or contract lean/agile/devops expert
